# GPUSPPM
This is the source code and build instructions for **GPUSPPM** (*Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping* implemented in **OpenGL** designed to run natively on a **GPU**).\
\
This code was originally written by **Toshiya Hachisuka** https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~thachisu/ some time around 2011 and was originally hosted here: (The website has long been offline, but a version can be found on the Internet Archive here: https://web.archive.org/web/20141216214724/http://bee-www.com/) \
\
**NOTE:** I did not write any of this code, I simply edited the source to make it compile on Linux. I am also uploading it to Github to make it accessible to everyone.\
\
The source for a **Windows** compile and a **Linux** compile are provided. A prebuilt binary for Windows is also provided (this was compiled by Toshiya Hachisuka).

# Build Instructions - Linux/Ubuntu:
It is assumed that you have already installed the appropriate drivers for your GPU. This program will not run if you haven't done this.\
\
There are a few dependencies we will need to install in order to make this run. **GPUSPPM** requires **OpenGL**, **FreeGLUT**, and **GLEW**. Install them by typing this into a terminal:\
\
```sudo apt install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew-dev```\
```sudo apt install mesa-utils```\
\
If you already have these in your system, you will get a *warning*, this is fine.\
\
Once you have successfully installed all of the dependencies, you can now move on to downloading this repository and compiling the source code.\
\
Clone this repository by typing this into a terminal:\
\
```git clone https://github.com/dat-boi-lux/GPUSPPM.git```\
\
Once the repository has downloaded onto your system, navigate to this folder (On Ubuntu, this folder should be somewhere in your *Home* directory and should be named **GPUSPPM**).\
\
Then open a terminal window in this directory. **Note:** In *Linux Mint* and possibly other graphical Linux distros, you can do this by: **Right-Clicking** inside your file explorer window and selecting **Open in Terminal**.\
\
It is time to compile the source code. We need to tell our c++ compiler (**GCC**) what libraries to use in order for this to compile properly. I.e. Type this into the terminal window you opened in the last step:\
\
```g++ gpusppmLINUX.cpp -o gpusppm -lGL -lGLU -lglut```\
\
You should now have successfully compiled **GPUSPPM**.
